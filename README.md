# Beginner's Guide to iOS Jailbreaking

So youâ€™ve asked for my help in jailbreaking your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch? 

Wonderful choice!

This document is a guide for how to do it both safely, and without error.

**A few notes before we begin:**
* **_If this is your first time jailbreaking, make sure to follow these instructions precisely to prevent unforeseen issues that could arise_**
* **_If you jailbreak your phone, you agree that your warranty (if any), will be void, and some repair centers may refuse to service your phone if it is jailbroken (see the section about repairing your phone for more info)_**
* **_I, Anden Wieseler, cannot be held liable for any issues that arise from jailbreaking any device from the use of this guide, any of the methods mentioned, or any of the software or hardware required. Your device is your responsibility. While I may provide some support, you jailbreak your phone at your own risk, and any fees or legal action is your responsibility as well._**

If you agree to these terms, let's move forward! 


## Section I: Introduction to Jailbreaking

### Section I-a: What is a jailbreak?

A jailbreak refers to exploiting a vulnerabilty in iOS/iPadOS code that allows for access to parts of the system that Apple usually wouldnt allow, and allows users to install different 3rd party programs and binaries from outside of the Apple App Store.

Jailbreaks are based on exploited vulnerabilities in the operating system itself. These vulnerabilities are found by iOS security researchers who report the bugs to Apple, to help make iOS and iPadOS more secure.

### Section I-b: What is the purpose of a jailbreak?

iOS Jailbreaking has a couple different purposes.

Typically, users will jailbreak their devices to customize their devices in a way that stock iOS won't allow. In fact, many jailbreak tweaks go on to become real features in future iOS and iPadOS updates (even though Apple won't admit that).

### Section I-c: Is it safe to do?

Jailbreaking an iOS device, in itself, is typically safe. What you do with your jailbreak will determine if your device stays secure. Typically this means only installing trusted repos and tweaks, and changing the root password on your device, so hackers have a harder time of trying to hack your phone and stealing your data. Think of it like any other computer.

### Section I-d: Is it legal?

As of right now, yes. Jailbreaking was deemed legal in a DMCA exemption in 2009 and has been renewed since.

**Note that piracy, even when done using a jailbreak, is still illegal**

### Section I-e: So you've talked about so-called "tweaks" and "repos". What are they?

When you jailbreak your device, a new application is installed; a package manager. On most modern jailbreaks, this package manager is called Cydia (which literally means "worm in the apple"). Think of this like your jailbreak app store. There's something different about this app store though. You can get your apps (Tweaks in this case) from many different sources. These are called repositories (or repos for short). Inside these repositories are tweaks. Tweaks are 3rd party binaries made by developers that change parts of the system to do different things. Some are free, and some you have to pay for, just like any other software.

## Section II: Picking your jailbreak method

So you know what a jailbreak is, but now you're probably wondering, "how do you do it?"

Well, there are different types of jailbreaks:

Type of Jailbreak|What it means
---|---
Untethered|This type of jailbreak is usually executed from a computer, but your jailbreak will stay applied betweeen device reboots; **This type of jailbreak is not that common anymore**.
Psuedo-untethered|This type of jailbreak involves sideloading an app to your device, and applying the jailbreak from the app, then installing a package that will allow you to run the jailbreak every time the device is booted, giving the illusion of an untethered jailbreak; **This type of jailbreak is not very common**.
Tethered|This type of jailbreak involves installing custom firmware to the device, and using a computer to boot the phone; **This type of jailbreak is not very common anymore**.
Semi-tethered|This type of jailbreak requires a computer to boot the device jailbroken, but the device will run unjailbroken just fine without a computer. **There are currently semi-tethered jailbreaks availible**
Semi-untethered|**This is the most common jailbreak type nowadays, and there are semi-untethered jailbreaks availible.** This type of jailbreak involves sideloading an app to the device and applying the jailbreak from the app. The jailbreak is unapplied if the device is rebooted, in which case the user can rejailbreak from the app.

For the purposes of this guide, I will assume you are on iOS 13. Read through the options below, and pick which one you want to use.

**_Note: Not all devices are currently jailbreakable. If your device is not jailbreakable, make sure to turn off Automatic Updates in settings and DO NOT update your iOS version. Wait for a jailbreak to be released for the version you are already on. That's the jailbreak rule of thumb._**
